# amazon-associate-ts
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xChrisPx/amazon-associate-ts.png)](https://travis-ci.org/xChrisPx/amazon-associate-ts)

Rebuilt of v0.3.0 of [this repository](https://github.com/snd/amazon-associate) in typescript

Since it was not really being maintained I decided to rebuild it in TypeScript to make
it more easily extendable and safer.

amazon-associate is a simple interface to amazon associate reports for nodejs

### install

```
npm install amazon-associate
```

### use

```javascript
var Amazon = require('amazon-associate');

var amazon = new Amazon({
    associateId: 'your amazon associate id',
    password: 'your password',
    host: 'assoc-datafeeds-na.amazon.com', // (default 'assoc-datafeeds-eu.amazon.com')
    debug: true // print debug output to the console (optional)
})

amazon.getEarnings(new Date(2012, 5, 22), function(err, earnings) {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }
    console.log(earnings);
});
```
